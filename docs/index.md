# erc-checker

A JavaScript library and CLI tool for [ERC](https://o2r-info/erc-spec) execution and result checking.  
The checker is part of the project [o2r](https://o2r.info/).

## Installation

**From npm**

```bash
npm install erc-checker
```

**From source**

Install the current development version directly from GitHub:
 
`npm install --save git+https://github.com/o2r-project/erc-checker.git`

Alternatively, the git repository may be cloned and packed into an npm package locally using the following console commands. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/o2r-project/erc-checker.git
cd erc-checker
npm pack          
```

The `npm pack` command creates a tarball named `erc-checker-x.y.z.tgz` in the same directory.
This resulting tarball is a fully functioning npm package.
It may then be installed into any project with:

```bash
npm install /path/to/tarball/erc-checker-x.y.z.tgz`
